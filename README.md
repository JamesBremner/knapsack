# knapsack
3D  Bin packing code direct from psuedocode

Implements algorithms presented in "Algorithms for 3D guillotine cutting problems: Unbounded knapsack,
cutting stock and strip packing" by Queiroz et al, which can be found in the doc folder

The repository contains test programs and applications exploring the academic papers.  

There is also a practical application for 3D bin packing that uses some of the academic ideas to optimise 3D cutting.  Anyone interested in the practical application is reccomended to check out the Timber Yard repository, which is focussed on real world problems.  https://github.com/JamesBremner/timberYard
